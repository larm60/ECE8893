This is the code we used to train and create our CNN model in Pytorch.

We created our own model based off the paper here: 
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9531841

We trained the model using this notebook as reference:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/mosheyerachmiel/ecg-classification

The resnet_bin.py file was used to export the .bin files of the model. The basic .py file was provided by Ashwin Bhat, and some modifications were made for this project. In addition, the file uses Model.py and the model_fold_6.pth to generate the .bin files.
