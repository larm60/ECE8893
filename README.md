##How to Run the Code

- Use ```make``` to run simulation test using floating-point values.
- Use ```make debug``` to run simulation and print floating-point values for debugging.
- Use ```make hls_sim``` to run simulation using fixed-point values. 
- Use ```make hls_debug``` to run simulation and print fixed-point values for debugging. (You may not need to run this)
- Use ```make synth``` to run synthesis.
