1. Model trained with the following parameters:
batch_size=256
epochs=10
learning rate=1e-3
folds=10

2. To generate the bin files, I used the model_fold_4.pth (Based on the training and validation loss graph on the .ipynb)

3. Model.py and model_fold_4.pth is used by resnet_bin.py to generate the .bin files
